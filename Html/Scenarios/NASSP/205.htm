the spacecraft/LM adapter panels on the SIVB was deployed only 25° instead of
the normal 45°. It had opened fully, but a retention cable designed to prevent
the panel from closing had become stuck and the panel had partially closed.
This was not a problem because the panels would be jettisoned on future

with the S-IVB, a 16.3-second phasing maneuver was performed at 003:20:09.9
using the service module reaction control system. This resulted in an orbit of
165.2 by 124.8 n mi.</p>

anticipated during the six subsequent revolutions. An additional phasing

rendezvous with the S-IVB. The first firing, a 9.36-second corrective
combination maneuver at 026:24:55.66, was necessary to achieve the desired 1.32°
phase and 8.0 nautical mile altitude offset so that the second firing would
produce an orbit coelliptic with that of the S-IVB. The result was an orbit of
194.1 by 123.0 n mi. During this period, the sextant was used to track the
S-IVB, which was visible in reflected sunlight. The 7.76-second firing at
028:00:56.47 occurred when the spacecraft was 80 n mi behind and 7.8 n mi below
the SIVB, and created a more circularized orbit of 153.6 by 113.9 n mi.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>The two firings achieved the desired conditions for the
46-second rendezvous terminal phase initiation, which occurred at 029:16:33,
about four- and one-half minutes earlier than planned because of a minor
variation in the orbit. A small midcourse correction was made at 029:37:48,
followed by a 708-second braking maneuver at 029:43:55, and final closure to
within 70 feet of the tumbling S-IVB. Station keeping was performed for 25
minutes starting at 029:55:43 in an orbit of 161.0 by 122.1 n mi, after which a
5.4-second service module reaction control system posigrade maneuver removed
the CSM from the vicinity of the S-IVB stage. The crew maneuvered the CSM
around the S-IVB in order to inspect and photograph it.</p>

amount of discussion about whether the crew should wear helmets and gloves

it remained during zero gravity conditions. It was decided 48 hours prior to
entry, and at the crew’s insistence, that helmets and gloves would not be worn.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apollo 7 mission was successful in every respect. All
spacecraft systems operated satisfactorily, and all but one of the detailed
test objectives were met. As an engineering test flight, Apollo 7 demonstrated
the performance of the orbital safing experiment, the adequacy of attitude
control in both the manual and automatic modes, and that the vehicle systems
could perform for extended periods in orbit. For the first time, a mixed cabin
atmosphere consisting of 65 percent oxygen and 35 percent nitrogen was used
aboard an American piloted spacecraft. All previous flights had used 100
percent oxygen, a procedure changed as a result of recommendations made by the Apollo
1 fire investigation board. Another “first” was the availability of hot and
cold drinking water for the crew as a by-product of the service module fuel
cells, an important element for piloted lunar excursions. Consumables usage was
maintained at safe levels, and permitted the introduction of additional flight
activities toward the end of the mission.</p>
