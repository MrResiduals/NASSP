performed various housekeeping functions, a voice and telemetry test, and an
oxygen purge system check. LM functions and consumables checked out well.

landing. The crew checked the handling qualities of the LM at 102:41:53 and
switched to automatic guidance ten seconds later. The landing radar switched to
“lowscale” at 102:42:19 as the LM descended below 2,500 feet altitude. The LM
was maneuvered manually 1,100 feet down range from the preplanned landing point
during the final 2.5 minutes of descent. The final alarm occurred at 102:42:58,

margin-left:-.25pt'>During the final approach, the commander noted that the
landing point toward which the spacecraft was headed was in the center of a
large crater that appeared extremely rugged, with boulders of five to ten feet

translate beyond the rough terrain area.</p>

the LM ladder, he deployed the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly from the
descent stage. A camera in the module provided live television coverage as he
descended. The commander’s left foot made first contact with the lunar surface
at 02:56:15 GMT on 21 July (22:56:15 EDT on 20 July) at 109:24:15. His first

television camera from the descent stage, obtained a panorama, and placed the
camera on its tripod in position to view the subsequent surface extravehicular
operations.</p>

the crew donned biological isolation garments and exited the CM into a rubber
boat, where they were scrubbed down with an iodine solution to protect against
“lunar germs.” They were then retrieved by helicopter and taken to the primary
recovery ship, where they arrived 63 minutes after splashdown. The CM was recovered
125 minutes later. The estimated CM weight at splashdown was 10,873.0 pounds,

margin-left:-.25pt'>The Apollo 11 mission, including a piloted lunar landing
and surface exploration, was conducted with skill, precision, and relative
ease. The excellent performance of the spacecraft in the preceding four
missions and the thorough planning in all aspects of the program permitted the
safe and efficient execution of this mission. The following conclusions were
made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
effectiveness of pre-mission training was reflected in the skill and precision
with which the crew executed the lunar landing. Manual control while
maneuvering to the desired landing point was satisfactorily exercised.</p>
