to 274.9 by 112.6 n mi and lightened the spacecraft so that it could be
controlled by the reaction control system engines later in the mission and be
in a better rescue position for rendezvous activities. During these two burns,
tests were made to measure the oscillatory response of a docked spacecraft to
provide data to improve the autopilot response for this configuration. The
fourth burn, at 028:24:41.37, was a 27.87-second phasing maneuver to shift the

deactivated at 051:00. The fifth service propulsion system firing, 43.26
seconds in duration, occurred at 054:26:12.27 to circularize the orbit for the
LM active rendezvous. The resulting orbit was 131.0 by 125.9 n mi, compared to

day of the mission. The plan was for the lunar module pilot to exit the LM,
transfer to the open hatch of the CM, and then return. This plan was
abbreviated from 2 hours 15 minutes to 39 minutes because of several bouts of
nausea experienced by the lunar module pilot on the preceding day and because
of the many activities required for rendezvous preparation.</p>

at 72:59:02, feet first and face up, and completed egress at 073:07. He was
wearing the extravehicular mobility unit backpack, which provided
communications and oxygen; it also circulated water through the suit to keep
him cool. His only connection to the LM was a 25-foot nylon rope to keep him
from drifting into space. He secured his feet in the “golden slippers,” the
gold painted restraints affixed to the surface outside the hatch, called the
“front porch” by the astronauts, where he remained while outside the LM.</p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>During this same period, the command module pilot,
dependent on CSM systems for life support, depressurized the CM and opened the
side hatch at 073:02:00. He partially exited the hatch for observation,
photography, and retrieval of thermal samples from the side of the CM. The
samples were missing, so he retrieved the service module thermal samples at
073:26. The lunar module pilot retrieved the LM thermal samples at 073:39.
Three minutes later, he began an abbreviated evaluation of translation and
body-attitude-control capability using the extravehicular transfer handrails.
The initially planned hand-over-hand trip from the LM to the CM was not made.
During this period, the lunar module pilot also completed 16 mm and 70 mm
photography of the command module pilot’s activities and the exterior of both
spacecraft.</p>

sextant sightings. During two successive revolutions, at 192:43 and 194:13, the
crew successfully tracked the Pegasus III satellite at a range of 1,000 n mi.
Pegasus III had been launched on 30 July 1965.</p>
