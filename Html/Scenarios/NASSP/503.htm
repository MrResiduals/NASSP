commander made the decision at 084:30 to cancel all activities during the final
four hours in lunar orbit to allow the crew to rest. A planned 26-minute
43-second television transmission of the Moon and Earth was made at 085:43:03,
on Christmas eve. It was during this transmission that the crew read from the
Bible the first ten verses of Genesis, and then wished viewers “Good night,
good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good
Earth.” An estimated one billion people in 64 countries heard or viewed the live
reading and greeting; delayed broadcasts reached an additional 30 countries that

operated as intended, and all primary mission objectives were successfully
accomplished. Crew performance was admirable throughout the mission.
Approximately 90 percent of the photographic objectives were accomplished and
60 percent of the additional lunar photographs requested as “targets of
opportunity” were also taken, despite fogging of three of the spacecraft
windows due to exposure of the window sealant to the space environment and
early curtailment of crew activities due to fatigue. Many smaller lunar
features, previously undiscovered, were photographed. These features were
located principally on the far side of the Moon in areas which had been
photographed only at much greater distances by automated spacecraft. In
addition, the heat shield system was not adversely affected by exposure to
cislunar space or to the lunar environment and performed as expected. The
following conclusions were made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

sleep periods adversely affected the normal circadian cycle of each crew member
and provided a poor environment for undisturbed rest. Mission activity
scheduling for the lunar orbit coast phase also did not provide adequate time
for required crew rest periods.</p>

observations of the lunar surface showed the “washout” effect (surface detail
being obscured by backscatter) to be much less severe than anticipated. In
addition, smaller surface details were visible in shadow areas at low sun
angles, indicating that lighting for lunar landing should be photometrically
acceptable.</p>

accommodate the change in Apollo 8 from an Earth orbital to a lunar mission,
pre-mission planning, crew training, and ground support reconfigurations were
completed in a time period significantly shorter than usual. The required
response was particularly demanding on the crew and, although not desirable on
a long-term basis, exhibited a capability which had never before been
demonstrated.</p>
